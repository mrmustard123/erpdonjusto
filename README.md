This project was made by me just for the use of our little company that works with beekeping.
It was made in a hurry, this is because I use several techonlgies like Doctrine 2 and RadPHP (rpcl libary)
It lacks of a lot of things, but It was useful for me because I knew it very well.
I needed to access the database directly some times because I didn't implement some functions
And in other cases I use Excel sheets for complete my work.
So there are many things to improve and automate and take in account that it was made for a little company.
But I have to say that It worked well for me because it does its work. 
I automate the consignators shop management with automatic generation of entries in the accounting system.
And also the warehouse and production system works togheter with the accounting system and it calculates the
propotion of the raw materials to produce the products in process and finished products and also the appropiate supplies.
It has a hives control system with hive health history and other interesting matters.
It has the Accounting Systems with diary, ledger, accounts plan, and a management section with multiple custom queries.
