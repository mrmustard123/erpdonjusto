# ERP Don Justo

This project was created as a custom solution for a small beekeeping company. It was developed *on the fly* under tight deadlines, which led to the use of various technologies, including **Doctrine 2** and **RADPHP (RPCL library)**. Despite its limitations, the system served its purpose effectively and streamlined several processes. I am now working on a new, from-scratch, general-purpose version called Agasaja ERP, built with Laravel + React communicating via an API. 
Below you will find an overview of its features and current limitations.

- **Incomplete Functionalities**: Some database interactions were performed directly due to the lack of implemented features.
- **Manual Processes**: In certain cases, Excel spreadsheets were used to complement the system's capabilities.
- **Room for Improvement**: The system requires significant improvements in automation and scalability, considering its initial purpose was tailored for a small company.

## Acknowledgments

Although this system was built with time constraints, it fulfilled its intended purpose by:

- Automating key processes.
- Reducing manual workload.
- Enabling better management of beekeeping operations.

There’s still much to enhance, but it’s been a valuable tool for our company. 😊
